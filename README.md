This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: violating subtype constraints.  The `Positive` subtype is defined to only allow positive integer values.  Attempting to assign 0 to the variable `X` results in a constraint error at compile time or runtime, depending on the Ada compiler's settings. The solution involves ensuring the initial value respects the subtype's constraints.
